# README

Triangle is a portable, easy to use library, which are common tools or pieces of code adopted from my other projects. You are welcome to use this project to help you quickly develop a portable C/C++ project, able to run on both Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux system.

What features are Triangle currently available:
* data container, list (array), dictionary map (also known as hash map), binary trees etc.
* encapsulated TCP/UDP APIs.
* system file IOs, to find, search, write and read data.
* HASH coding, supports MD5, SHA-1.
* host information.

# Prerequire
